# Quantitative-Trade-Demo
this project shows how to do quant trade with vnpy

## copy file to official vnpy directory

because the minute bar and tick data are charged if you use rice quant's service, tianqin's service is a better alternative. copy tqdata.py to <path/to/vnpy>/trader/tqdata.py and install [tqsdk](https://github.com/shinnytech/tqsdk-python).

## the backtesting demo

back test with

```python
python3 backtesting.py
```
